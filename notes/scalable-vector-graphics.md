#SVG

##SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics in XML [XML10].
##SVG allows for three types of graphic objects:
##*   vector graphic shapes (e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and curves)
##*   images and text. Graphical objects can be grouped, styled, transformed and
##*   composited into previously rendered objects.

##The feature set includes nested transformations, clipping paths, alpha masks, filter effects and template objects.
